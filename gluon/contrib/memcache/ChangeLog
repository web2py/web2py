   * Version 1.43

   *  eliott reported a bug in the 1.42 related to the socket timeout code
      causing a traceback due to the timeout value not being set.

   * Version 1.42

   *  Paul Hummer set up a Launchpad project which I'm going to start using
      to track patches and allow users to set up their own bzr branches and
      manage marging in the upstream patches with their own.

         https://launchpad.net/python-memcached

   *  Patch from Jehiah Czebotar which does: Changing the calls to
      mark_dead() to make them dereference tuples, reducing timeout on
      sockets to 3 seconds, settable via setting Host._SOCKET_TIMEOUT.

   *  Patches from Steve Schwarz for set_multi() to return the full set of
      keys if all servers are down.  Previously would not report any keys.

   *  Fix from Steve Schwarz delete_multi() argument "seconds" not being
      correctly handled.  Changed it to "time" to match all other calls.

   *  Patch from Peter Wilkinson to support using unix domain sockets.
      He reports that tests succeed with with memcached daemons running,
      the normal and a domain socket started via
      "memcached -s memcached.socket".  I massaged it quite a bit.

      To use domain sockets, use a connect string of "unix:/path/to/socket"
      Note however that if you are using a host name of "unix", it will now
      detect "unix:11211" as being a domain socket with the name "11211".
      In this case, please use "inet:unix:11211".

      Because of this, it is now preferred to use a connect string prefix
      of "inet:" or "unix:".

   * Version 1.41

   * Patch from Jehiah Czebotar to catch an additional server disconnect
     situation.

   * Patch from Andrey Petrov to add the "append" and "replace" commands.

Tue, 18 Sep 2007 20:52:09 -0600  Sean Reifschneider  <jafo@tummy.com>

   * Version 1.40

   * Updated setup.py file that uses distutils provided by Kai Lautaportti.

   * Prevent keys from containing ASCII character 127 as well, patch provided
     by Philip Neustrom.

   * Added ability to overload the persistent_load/id, patch provided by
     Steve Schwarz.

   * Fixed ability to pass (server_hash,key) in place of key in Client.set()
     Reported by Alexander Klyuev.

Tue, 14 Aug 2007 14:43:27 -0600  Sean Reifschneider  <jafo@tummy.com>

   * Version 1.39

   * Michael Krause reports the previous version doesn't work for
     _val_to_store_info() calls because it's defined as a staticmethod.
     Removing staticmethod decorator.  Also confirmed by Kai Lautaportti,
     with suggested fix of removing staticmethod.

Fri, 10 Aug 2007 17:50:13 -0600  Sean Reifschneider  <jafo@tummy.com>

   * Version 1.38

   * Matt McClanahan submitted a patch that allow add() to have a
     min_compress_len argument.

   * Steve Schwarz submitted a patch allowing user-defined picklers.

   * Michael Krause suggested checking the return value to prevent an
     exception from being raised in _set() when a value is too large to be
     stored.

Fri, 27 Jul 2007 01:55:48 -0600  Sean Reifschneider  <jafo@tummy.com>

   * Version 1.37

   * Fixing call from add() to _set() with parameter for min_compress_len.
     Reported by Jeff Fisher.

Thu, 07 Jun 2007 04:10:31 -0600  Sean Reifschneider  <jafo@tummy.com>

   * Version 1.36

   * Patch by Dave St.Germain to make the Client() class sub-class
     threadlocal to help with multi-threading issues.  Only available in
     Python 2.4 and above.

   * Patch by James Robinson with:
      1) new set_multi method.
      2) factored out determining the flags, length, and value to store
         from set() into method _val_to_store_info() for use by both set()
         and set_multi().
      3) send_cmds() method on host which doesn't apply the trailing '\r\n'
         for use by set_multi.
      4) check_key() extended a bit to allow for testing the prefix passed
         to set_multi just once, not once per each key.
      5) Patch also enables support for auto compression in set, set_multi,
         and replace.

   * Suggestion by Helge Tesdal, fixes in check_key for non-string keys.

   * NOTE: On a farm of clients with multiple servers, all clients will
     need to be upgraded to this version.  The next patch changes the
     server hash.

   * Philip Neustrom supplied a patch to change the server hash function to
     binascii.crc32.  The original "hash()" call is not cross-platform, so
     big and little endian systems accessing the same memcache may end up
     hitting different servers.  Restore the old functionality by calling:
     "memcached.serverHashFunction = hash" after importing memcache.

   * Philip Neustrom points out that passing Unicode keys or values causes
     problems because len(key) or len(value) is not equal to the number of
     bytes that are required to store the key/value.  Philip provides a
     patch which raises an exception in this case.  Raises
     memcache.Client.MemcachedStringEncodingError exception in this case.

   * NOTE: If you recompiled memcached to increase the default 1MB max
     value size, you will need to call "memcached.MAX_SERVER_VALUE_LENGTH = N"
     or memcached will not store values larger than the default 1MB.

   * Philip Neustrom includes another patch which checks that the key
     doesn't exceed the memcache server's max size.  If it does, the item
     is silently not stored.

   * Philip Neustrom added a bunch of sanity checks.

   * Jehiah Czebotar provided a patch to make the add() and replace()
     functions return 0 when the add or replace fails, similar to how set()
     works.

   * Version 1.34

   * In get_multi, if the recv loop reads 0 bytes, raising an EOFError.
     Identified by Jim Baker.

Tue, 05 Sep 2006 14:06:50 -0600  Sean Reifschneider  <jafo@tummy.com>

   * Version 1.33

   * Including patch from Yoshinori K. Okuji to read in larger chunks for
   readline() calls.  This should dramatically improve performance under
   some circumstances.

Sun, 03 Sep 2006 14:02:03 -0600  Sean Reifschneider  <jafo@tummy.com>

   * Version 1.32

   * Including patch from Philip Neustrom which checks keys sent to the
   server for length and bad characters.

Sat, 20 May 2006 14:51:28 -0600  Sean Reifschneider  <jafo@tummy.com>

   * Version 1.31

   *  Rolled version 1.30 since the Danga folks are now listing this
   version as the official version.  Removing the "tummy" from the version
   number, and incrementing so that it's clear it's more recent than "1.2".

   * Patch applied from Simon Forman for handling of weighted hosts.

   * Added a little more meat to the README.

   * cludwin at socallocal suggested that the write-combining with
   sendall() may not be beneficial.  After testing on both SMP and non-SMP
   machines, I can't see a significant benefit to not doing the
   write-combining, even on large strings.  The benefits of write-combining
   on smaller strings seems to be significant on UP machines in tight loops.
   Even on strings that are larger than 2MB, there seems to be no benefit to
   splitting out the writes.

   * Changing a printf to debuglog and catching a pickle exception, patch
   submitted by Justin Azoff.

   * Alex Stapleton found that the sendall call was slow for writing data
   larger than several kilobytes.  I had him test a change to his patch,
   which worked as well, but was simpler.  The code now does two sendall
   calls, one for the data and one for the line termination, if the data is
   larger than 100 bytes.

   * Simplifying the readline() function and speeding it up ~25%.
   * Fixing a bug in readline() if the server drops, mark_dead() was not
      being properly called.

   * Adding "stats()" and "flush_all()" methods.

Thu, 10 Aug 2003 12:17:50 -0700  Evan Martin  <martine@danga.com>
