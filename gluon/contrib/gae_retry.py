    ======================================================================

    This function wraps the AppEngine Datastore API to autoretry
    datastore timeouts at the lowest accessible level.

    The benefits of this approach are:

    1. Small Footprint:  Does not monkey with Model internals
                         which may break in future releases.
    2. Max Performance:  Retrying at this lowest level means
                         serialization and key formatting is not
                         needlessly repeated on each retry.
    At initialization time, execute this:

    >>> autoretry_datastore_timeouts()

    Should only be called once, subsequent calls have no effect.

    >>> autoretry_datastore_timeouts() # no effect

    Default (5) attempts: .1, .2, .4, .8, 1.6 seconds

    Parameters can each be specified as floats.

    :param attempts: maximum number of times to retry.
    :param interval: base seconds to sleep between retries.
    :param exponent: rate of exponential back-off.
