## Google App Engine deployment

    cp examples/app.yaml ./
    cp handlers/gaehandler.py ./
    
Then edit ./app.yaml and replace "yourappname" with yourappname.

## Important reminder about this GIT repo

An important part of web2py is the Database Abstraction Layer (DAL). In early 2015 this was decoupled into a separate code-base (PyDAL). In terms of git, it is a sub-module of the main repository.

The use of a sub-module requires a one-time use of the --recursive flag for git clone if you are cloning web2py from scratch.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/web2py/web2py.git

If you have an existing repository, the commands below need to be executed at least once:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

If you have a folder gluon/dal you must remove it:

    rm -r gluon/dal

PyDAL uses a separate stable release cycle to the rest of web2py. PyDAL releases will use a date-naming scheme similar to Ubuntu. Issues related to PyDAL should be reported to its separate repository.
